                    On these pages the documentation for various MEDvision360 REST APIs can be found.
                    Besides providing documentation, these pages can be used to experiment with the various REST APIs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    The following pages are available:
                    <ul>
                      <li><a href="api.html">The API documentation</a> with experimentation possibilities.</li>
                      <li><a href="info.html">Background information</a> for the APIs, including various document formats.</li>
                      <li><a href="datatypes.html">Information on datatypes</a> and how they are represented by the MEDvision360 APIs.</a></li>
                    </ul>
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Selecting other APIs</b><br/>
                    On top of the API documentation page the server/service can be selected. When a server or service is selected,
                    the documentation shown is the live documentation of the selected server/service. This server is also used for
                    testing the APIs.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Try it out!</b></br>
                    In the documentation pages, every method has a 'Try it out!' button. When this button is pressed, the information
                    in the input boxes is send to the server using the API. The result returned from the server is shown below this button
                    when it becomes available.<br/>
                    Please try as much as possible to get a feeling of how our APIs work.<br/>
                    Do not be afraid of breaking anything. If you managed to break something, please report it using the 'Report Bug' 
                    button.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Login</b></br>
                    Some resources require an API key (which can be provided on top of the page) and some resource require login.
                    To login, first select the /user/login method and fill in the form by pressing on the 'Get token' button.
                    After this, press the 'Try it out!' button and all futher API calls use the selected Google account for authentication.
                    This works in exactly the same way as normal clients would do it.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>SSL certificates</b></br>
                    These pages work best when the browser understands the certificates used to
                    protect these pages. Since these certificates are not signed by an official
                    entity, the certificates can be installed by following
                    <a href="https://zorggemak.atlassian.net/wiki/x/hYDH">these instructions</a>.</br>
                    If there are problems, please check and make sure the browser trusts the certificates of this server and the application servers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>A final note on privacy</b></br>
                    The dev and test servers are publicly accessible. So any information you put in there can be seen by anybody.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <b>Have fun!</b>
